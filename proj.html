	<h1> Why </h1>
	<h2> Everybody deserves equal education and the quality of our eduction should not be determined by where we live </h2>
	<h1> What </h1>
	<h2> We want to raise awareness to both parents and children of the resources they have in their neighborhoods. We also want to give all students an equal playing field when it comes to their education </h2>
	<h1> How </h1>
	<h2> We will create a buddy system in which highschool and college students volunteer to be mentors for kids in low-income districts. They will also act as tutors and people to guide them through their middle school and high school experience. In addition, there will be a website where kids can sign up and parents can learn about opportunities and can choose from various languages to translate the page. </h2>
